@section Q_QuickStartIntro Introduction
<STRONG>
This page is under revision to better reflect the latest installation and 
basic operation of the <b>MIDAS package</b>.
</STRONG>
 
These pages contain a step-by-step description of the installation procedure of 
the MIDAS package on several platforms, as well as the procedure to run a demo 
sample experiment. Once this is successful, the frontend or the analyzer can be moved 
to another computer to test the remote connection capability.

@section Q_SVN MIDAS Package Source (SVN and tarball)
The <b>MIDAS source code</b> is subject to the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GPL</a>

An <a href="http://savannah.psi.ch/viewcvs/trunk/?root=midas" > online SVN web site 
</a> is available for the latest developments and for easy download. See specific
instructions under \ref Q_Linux_Midas_Installation "Linux" or \ref Q_Windows_installation "Windows".

The MIDAS Package source (tarball) and some binaries are also kept in
<a href="http://midas.psi.ch/download" > PSI </a> or at 
<a href="http://ladd00.triumf.ca/~daqweb/ftp/"> TRIUMF </a>.

@section  Q_Linux_installation Installation

Throughout the following description the MIDAS package is assumed to be installed under
  the directory \b $HOME/packages/midas 
  <br> while the experiment specific directory
  is \b $HOME/online . The user name is <em>johnfoo</em>. 
<br>

@subsection  Q_Linux_Environment_Variables Environment Variables
The following @ref BO_Environment_variables needs to be setup, e.g.:
  csh:
  @code
  #!/bin/echo You must source
  setenv CVS_RSH ssh
  setenv MIDASSYS $HOME/packages/midas  
  setenv ROOTSYS  $HOME/packages/root   ** do not setup ROOTSYS if NOT using ROOT
  setenv MIDAS_EXPTAB $HOME/online/exptab ** if not setup,  defaults to  /etc/exptab
  setenv PATH .:$MIDASSYS/linux/bin:$HOME/packages/roody/bin:$ROOTSYS/bin:$PATH
  #end
  @endcode
  \n
  bash:
  @code
  #!/bin/echo You must source
  export CVS_RSH=ssh
  export MIDASSYS=$HOME/packages/midas  
  export ROOTSYS=$HOME/packages/root   ** do not setup ROOTSYS if NOT using ROOT
  export MIDAS_EXPTAB=$HOME/online/exptab ** if not setup,  defaults to  /etc/exptab
  export PATH=.:$MIDASSYS/linux/bin:$HOME/packages/roody/bin:$ROOTSYS/bin:$PATH
  #end
  @endcode
  - mkdir $HOME/packages
  - Logout and login again, or source .cshrc (source .bashrc) for the change to take effect.
 \n

\anchor idx_ROOT_installation 
@subsection  Q_Linux_Root_Installation ROOT Package Installation 

For full MIDAS operation \b ROOT is needed for the data logging and analysis packages.

  - Identify the Linux version: RH9 (Red Hat Linux 9), FC3 (Fedora Core 3),
    RHEL4/SL4 (Red Hat Enterprise LInux 4/Scientific Linux 4): more /etc/redhat-release
  - cd $HOME/packages
  - ln -s /triumfcs/trshare/olchansk/root/root_vNNN_VVV root, where NNN is the 
    latest available version of ROOT
    ("ls -l /triumfcs/trshare/olchansk/root") and VVV is the
    Linux version code (RH9, FC3, SL4, etc).
    For example: /triumfcs/trshare/olchansk/root/root_v5.10.00_SL40
  - Check that ROOT works: "echo $ROOTSYS", "$ROOTSYS/bin/root"
  \n
    <br>
     <b>Note:</b> ROOT is not essential to run MIDAS. Some experiments use a custom logger or analyser. If ROOT
      is NOT installed, the environment variable ROOTSYS must be removed:
      @code
      unsetenv ROOTSYS
      @endcode
      
    <br>


@subsection  Q_Linux_Midas_Installation MIDAS Package Installation

The source code can be extracted from the
   <a HREF="http://savannah.psi.ch/viewcvs/trunk/?root=midas" > SVN repository</a>.
  Anonymous access is available under the username \b svn and password \b svn 
  which may be required several time. The SVN web interface provides a quick 
  \b tarball. This suggested extraction method is shown below.
<br>
The MIDAS package requires the \b mxml auxiliary package which can be found at the same 
    SVN site as MIDAS. mxml and MIDAS are extracted at the same directory level as follows:
  @code
  cd $HOME/packages
  svn co svn+ssh://svn@savannah.psi.ch/afs/psi.ch/project/meg/svn/midas/trunk midas
  svn co svn+ssh://svn@savannah.psi.ch/afs/psi.ch/project/meg/svn/mxml/trunk mxml
  cd midas
  make
  ls $MIDASSYS/linux/bin   ... should contains odbedit and all the MIDAS applications.
  @endcode
  \n

 \anchor idx_ROME_installation 
@subsection  Q_Linux_Rome_Installation ROME Package Installation

  The PSI ROME analysis package can be found at
  <a href="http://midas.psi.ch/rome/index.html" >ROME analyzer</a>
  The same extraction procedure as for the MIDAS package can be followed. For its operation please
  refer to the <a href="http://midas.psi.ch/rome/index.html" >ROME web site</a>.
  @code
  cd $HOME/packages
  svn co svn+ssh://svn@savannah.psi.ch/afs/psi.ch/project/meg/svn/rome/trunk rome
  cd rome
  make
  @endcode
  
\anchor idx_ROODY_installation
@subsection  Q_Linux_Roody_Installation ROODY Package Installation

   <a href="http://ladd00.triumf.ca/~daqweb/doc/roody/html" >
  ROODY</a> is a Histogram display tool. This package is supported by the Triumf DAQ group. Its 
  installation is similar to 
  the MIDAS package.
  @code
  cd $HOME/packages
  svn checkout svn://ladd00.triumf.ca/roody/trunk roody
  cd roody
  make
  $HOME/packages/roody/bin/roody   ... to run the program
  @endcode

@section  Q_Linux_Basic_Test Basic test

@subsection  Q_Linux_Hardware_Requirements Hardware Requirements

These instructions assume that accessibility to hardware such as VME or CAMAC is available. 
An ADC is also required, with signals sent to its gate.

@subsection  Q_Linux_Software_Requirements Software Requirements
Packages ROOT, MIDAS and ROODY have been installed.

@subsection Q_Linux_Expt_Setup How to Setup the MIDAS Experiment

NOTE: these instructions provide \b local access to the experiment. For \b remote access, refer to 
\ref Q_Linux_Installation_Considerations .

  - Create a new user for this daq system (johnfoo)
  - login as the new user
  - mkdir online
  - cd online
  - mkdir elog history data
  - create the  \ref Q_Linux_Exptab "exptab" file "$HOME/online/exptab" following the example below
       - The first parameter is the MIDAS experiment name e.g. "simptest1"
       - The second parameter is the location of MIDAS shared memory buffers  e.g."/home/johnfoo/online"
   (by convention, $HOME/online), 
       - the third parameter is the username e.g. "johnfoo"
  @code
  simptest1 /home/johnfoo/online johnfoo
  @endcode
  \anchor start-all
  - copy $MIDASSYS/examples/experiment/* to the online directory.
  - make (creates frontend executable frontend.exe)
  @code
  cd online
  cp $MIDASSYS/examples/experiment/* .
  make
  @endcode
  - The analyzer will build properly if ROOT has been previously installed. 
  - At this point the frontend and the analyzer should be ready if no error where generated during the build.
    By running the script <b> start_daq.sh </b> several midas applications will be started in sequence.
   -# Cleanup previous midas application (if any).
   -# Start the midas web server [mhttpd]
   -# Start the frontend application in its own xterm (for debugging purpose).
   -# Start the analyzer application in its own xterm (for debugging purpose). 
   -# Start the Midas Data logger [mlogger]

   @code
   $ sh ./start_daq
   @endcode
   
 - Once all these applications are running, you can invoke the Midas web page by using your
   browser to http://localhost:8081 . A Midas run status page should be appearing with multiple buttons for 
   run control as well as equipment listing and application listing. Please refers to @ref RC_mhttpd for further information.
 - You can also run the MIDAS Online Editor [odbedit] in a new terminal to provide you command line access to the database. 
  - The content of the database is accessible with Unix-like commands. There are directories related to specifics 
    of the Midas environment. One in particular is the "Logger". Please refer to @ref F_Logging_Data for discussion on the different 
    logger configuration options.
 - Run can be started and stopped under odbedit or through the web page.
 - While a run is in progress, the midas application <b>mdump</b> will provide you an event dump of the collected
   data from the running frontend.
 - For further data processing/analysis, either the <b> midas analyzer </b> or the 
   <a href="http://daq-plone.triumf.ca/SR/rootana" > rootana </a> can used for data display as well. 
    @code
    $odbedit
	[local:exp:S]> ls
	...
	[local:exp:S]> help
	...
	[local:exp:S]> start
	[local:exp:S]> exit
	...
	$ mdump
	@endcode

@section Q_Linux_Installation_Considerations Installation Considerations

@subsection Q_Linux_Remote_Access Remote Access to the experiment

  While the above description in \ref  Q_Linux_Expt_Setup installs MIDAS under user privilege for standard operation, 
  MIDAS can also be installed in a more general way under root privilege. This method allows remote
  access to the package through the xinetd daemon mechanism. In order to implement this, some extra steps 
  are necessary as described here.
  
  - <b> It is to be noted that remote access can be also obtained under user privilege by starting the Midas server [mserver]
  by hand.</b>
  @code
  $ mserver -D
  @endcode

  Several system files needs to be modified (as root) for the full MIDAS implementation.
  - <b>/etc/services :</b> For remote access, inclusion of the "midas" service is needed.
   Add following line:
  \code 
  # midas service
  midas           1175/tcp                        # Midas server
  @endcode
  - <b>/etc/xinetd.d/midas :</b> Daemon definition. Create new file named \b midas
  \code 
  service midas
  {
           flags                   = REUSE NOLIBWRAP
           socket_type             = stream
           wait                    = no
           user                    = root
           server                  = /usr/local/bin/mserver
           log_on_success          += USERID HOST PID
           log_on_failure          += USERID HOST
           disable                 = no
  }
  @endcode
  - <b>/etc/ld.so.conf :</b> Dynamic Linked library list. Add directory pointing to 
  location of the midas.so file (add /usr/local/lib).
  \code 
  /usr/local/lib
  @endcode
  The system is now build by default in static, which makes it unecessary to setup
  the .so path through either the environment \b LD_LIBRARY_PATH or the ld.so.conf.
  - <b>/etc/exptab :</b> MIDAS Experiment definition file (see below).
<br><br>

\anchor idx_experiment_multiple
\anchor idx_exptab
@subsection Q_Linux_Exptab  Definition of Experiments (exptab)

  The MIDAS system supports <b> multiple experiments running at the same time on a single computer</b>.
  Even though it may not be efficient, this capability makes sense when the experiments
  are simple detector lab setups which share hardware resources for data collection.
  In order to support this feature, MIDAS requires a uniquely identified set of
  parameters for each experiment that is used to define the location of the Online Database.
  <br><br>
  Every experiment under MIDAS has its own ODB.
  In order to differentiate them, an experiment <b> name and directory </b> are assigned to each
  experiment. This allows several experiments to run concurrently on the same host
  using a common MIDAS installation.
  <br><br>
  Whenever a application specific to a particular experiment is started, the experiment name
  can be specified as a command line argument, or as an environment variable.
  <br><br>
  A list of all possible running experiments on a given machine is kept in the file
  \b exptab. This file \b exptab is expected by default to be located under
  \b /etc/exptab. This default location can be overwritten by the @ref BO_Environment_variables  "Environment Variable"
  @ref BO_MIDAS_EXPTAB.
  <br><br>
  \b The exptab file defines each experiment on the machine, with one line per experiment. Each line
  contains three parameters, i.e:
  <b>experiment name</b>, <b>experiment directory name</b> and <b>user name</b>.
  For example:
  \code
  #
  # Midas experiment list
  test   /home/johnfoo/online     johnfoo
  decay  /home/jackfoo/decay_daq  jackfoo
  @endcode
  <br>
  Experiments not defined in \b exptab are not accessible remotely, but can still be
  accessed locally using the @ref BO_Environment_variables "environment variable" @ref BO_MIDAS_DIR if defined.
  This environment variable superceeds the \b exptab definition.
  <br>
  \Note  Where more than one experiment is defined, the default name of the experiment to connect to can be
  provided using the  @ref BO_MIDAS_EXPT_NAME environment variable.

<hr>
@section Q_Linux_Demo_Examples Demo examples


  The midas file structure contains examples of code which should be used as a template.
  In the <b> midas/examples/experiment</b> directory you will find a full set for frontend and analysis code.
  The building of this example is performed with the \b Makefile of this directory.
  \code
  #-------------------------------------------------------------------
  # The following lines define directories. Adjust if necessary
  #                 
  DRV_DIR   = $(MIDASSYS)/drivers/bus
  INC_DIR   = $(MIDASSYS)/include
  LIB_DIR   = $(MIDASSYS)/linux/lib
  @endcode

  For testing the system, you can start the frontend as follow:
  \code
  > frontend
  Event buffer size      :     100000
  Buffer allocation      : 2 x 100000
  System max event size  :     524288

@section Q_Windows_installation Installation


Throughout the following description the MIDAS package is assumed to be found under
    the directory <b> \%SystemDrive%\\midas </b> 
<br>The experiment-specific directory
    is \b \%SystemDrive%\\online. The user name is <em>johnfoo</em>.

 - The package extraction under Windows is similar to the Linux. The \ref Q_SVN "SVN" site is used to
    gather the midas and mxml. The method can be the tarball or the \ref Q_SVN "svn" using the 
    <a href="http://tortoisesvn.net" > Tortoise package</a>.

 - Using the tarball mechanism:
  @code
 - Go to http://savannah.psi.ch/viewcvs/trunk/?root=midas
 - Click "Download tarball"
 - Extract trunk to %SystemDrive%
 - Rename trunk to midas
 - Go to http://savannah.psi.ch/viewcvs/trunk/?root=mxml
 - Click "Download tarball"
 - Extract trunk to %SystemDrive%
 - Rename trunk to mxml
  @endcode


  - Using the svn command under cygwin (pwd "svn" will be asked twice):
  @code
 cd %SystemDrive%\
 svn co svn+ssh://svn@savannah.psi.ch/afs/psi.ch/project/meg/svn/midas/trunk midas
 svn co svn+ssh://svn@savannah.psi.ch/afs/psi.ch/project/meg/svn/mxml/trunk mxml
  @endcode

  - Using the Tortoise package under windows (pwd "svn" will be requested twice)
   - Using the file browser go to the \%SystemDrive\%
   - right click and select "SVN checkout"
   - Fill the "URL of Repository:" with 
     svn+ssh://svn\@savannah.psi.ch/afs/psi.ch/project/meg/svn/midas/trunk
   - Fill the "Checkout directory" with C:\\midas
   - Start transfer.
   - Do the same for mxml
   - right click and select "SVN checkout"
   - Fill the "URL of Repository: with
     svn+ssh://svn\@savannah.psi.ch/afs/psi.ch/project/meg/svn/mxml/trunk
   - Fill the "Checkout directory" with C:\\mxml
   - Start transfer.

@subsection Q_Windows_Environment_Variables Environment Variables

Environment variables needs to be setup prior the MIDAS build;
  - from the "system properties" -> advanced -> Environment Variables, define new system
    variables \b MIDASSYS to \b c:\\midas (installation location).
  - from the "system properties" -> advanced -> Environment Variables, add to PATH system
    variables \b "%MIDASSYS%\nt\bin"
  - create file \b \%SystemRoot\%\\system32\\exptab with the following content.
  @code
  test c:\online johnfoo 
  @endcode   
  
  - The MIDAS build requires the Microsoft Visual C++ (200x) or .NET. 
    the corresponding environment variables for the compiler need to be set prior
    the MIDAS build. A batch file can be found under 
    "C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Visual Studio 5\\Common7\\Tools\\vsvar32.bat or similar...
    The build then can be started as follow.  
  @code 
  
  cd %MIDASSYS%
  nmake -f makefile.nt
  @endcode
