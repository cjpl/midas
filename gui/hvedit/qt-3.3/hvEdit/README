README file for hvEdit

---------------------------------------------------------

Before trying to install hvEdit you should read this file
which explains shortly how hvEdit is working and hence
what changes needed in order to use it for a particular MIDAS
experiment.

A few things to know:

* in the hvEdit.pro file two variables 'MidasRoot' and 'myHome' are defined.
  'MidasRoot' tells where to find the midas source directory, whereas 'myHome'
  identifies the path to the hvEdit source code. By default the executable
  and the startup file are installed under $myHome/bin and its subdirectories.
  
* hvEdit assumes that a system variable $MIDAS_ROOT exists. $MIDAS_ROOT should
  hold the path to the midas source directory. Unfortunately, in midas it is
  only required to have the varialbe $MIDASSYS pointing to the installation
  directory.
  
* hvEdit is working with a startup file 'hvEdit-expName.xml' where 'expName'
  is the name of the experiment. In this distribution there is an example
  startup file 'hvEdit-example.xml' holding the necessary tags. It is 
  installed in a subdirectory 'xmls'.
  
  This xml startup file holds the following informations:
    
    general:                general settings for hvEdit
      default_settings_dir: the path to the hv settings files
      default_doc_dir:      the path to the hvEdit help files
      no_of_hv_odb_roots:   number of hv roots. In the LEM experiment there are
                            2 such roots, one handles the tertiary beam line (FUG's)
                            the other all the detector high voltages, i.e. MCP's, PM's etc.
      termination_timeout:  timeout in (min). If within this timeout there is no user action,
                            hvEdit will terminate. Setting termination_timeout to a negative
                            number means that this feature will be disabled.
    odb_key:                MIDAS online data base (ODB) pathes or realtive pathes
      hv_root:              ODB path to the HV root. Various HV roots are allowed, though the
                            number must be entered in the general section with the label
                            no_of_hv_odb_roots.
      hv_names:             relative ODB path where to find the channel names
      hv_demand:            relative ODB path where to find the hv demand values
      hv_measured:          relative ODB path where to find the hv measured values
      hv_current:           relative ODB path where to find the measured currents
      hv_current_limit:     relative ODB path where to find the current limits
