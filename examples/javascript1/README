Example experiment "javascript1"

Purpose:
example and test of mhttpd javascript functions for interacting with ODB and MIDAS

To run:
use bash shell
assuming MIDAS is installed in $HOME/packages/midas on linux, otherwise edit setup.sh and Makefile
run make to build fejrpc.exe
run source ./setup.sh
when starting this experiment for the very first time, load experiment settings from odb.xml: odbedit -c "load odb.xml"
run ./start_daq.sh
mlogger and mhttpd should now be running
connect to the midas status page at http://localhost:8080 (port number is set in start_daq.sh
start the example frontend from the "programs" page
observe event number of example equipment is incrementing
go to the "example" page (click on "example" button on the midas status page)
on the example page, press buttons, read text, etc
to use MIDAS javascript functions, cut and paste these examples into your page
to use MIDAS jrpc functions, also study fejrpc.cxx

Enjoy,
K.O.
