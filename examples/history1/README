Example experiment "history1"

Purpose:
example and test of a simple periodic frontend writing slow controls data into midas history

To run:
use bash shell
assuming MIDAS is installed in $HOME/packages/midas on linux, otherwise edit setup.sh and Makefile
run make to build feslow.exe
run source ./setup.sh
when starting this experiment for the very first time, load experiment settings from odb.xml: odbedit -c "load odb.xml"
run ./start_daq.sh
mlogger and mhttpd should now be running
connect to the midas status page at http://localhost:8080 (port number is set in start_daq.sh
start the example frontend from the "programs" page
observe event number of equipment "slow" is incrementing
go to the "Slow" equipment page (click on "Slow" on the midas status page)
observe numbers are changing when you refresh the web page
from the midas status page, go to "history" -> "slow" - observe history plot for "SLOW[2]" shows a sine wave
from shell, examine contents of history file: "mhdump *.hst"
study feslow.cxx

Enjoy,
K.O.
