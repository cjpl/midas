Installations instructions for SCS_250 MSCB-USB adapter
=======================================================
S. Ritt, A. Suter, Dec. 2004

The SCS-250 MSCB-USB submaster can be used under Linux without
a kernel driver. However, the libusb library must be present to
be linked to the mscb.c library.

In order to make the SCS-250 device accessible by non-root users,
a hotplug script has to be installed. Follow these steps:

1) Add the line from the file usb.usermap_scs_250 to the file
   /etc/hotplug/usb.usermap
   
2) Copy the script scs_250 to /etc/hotplug/usb. By default, it
   gives all users access to scs_250. If you want to restict it to
   a single user, modify it like 

...   
then
    chown <user> "${DEVICE}"
    chmod 0666 "${DEVICE}"
fi
...

   where <user> has to be replaced by the user name which should
   have access to the device.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

A few comments and warnings: The usb devices are 'automatically' mounted
via hotplug mechanism under /proc/bus/usb/MMM/NNN, where MMM and NNN are
numbers (e.g. /proc/bus/usb/005/003). The script scs_250 is called when
adding the MSCB USB device and is changing the ownership and access
rights. Problem: The above statement is only true if scs_250 is the only
script under /etc/hotplug/usb. If there are more scripts, the stupid
hotplug mechanism is calling ALL the scripts present there. The culprit
is the function load_drivers found in /etc/hotplug/hotplug.functions. It
calles the function usbmodules which returns a list with all the
possible hotplug­scripts possibly able to handle the plugged in USB
device (MSCB USB). Then it loops over ALL these scripts, instead of
filtering just the sensible one (scs_250 in our case). Depending on the
order of the calls not the expected thing is happening. Since in our
case we are dealing with a measuring PC, I just changed all the scripts
(scs_250, usbcam) that nemu is owner and has full access, whereas all
the others have no rights. This is only an ugly workaround but I didn't
want to fool around in system bash­scripts. Therefore I have fed this
problem to AIT in the hope they will find a simple solution. In
principle this should be possible since load_drivers also gets the
Vendor and Prod. ID so that intelligent parsing of
/etc/hotplug/usb.usermap should easily allow to filter the correct scipt
out?!
